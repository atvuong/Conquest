/* 
Things to consider:
1. What happens if one player kills all others BUT remaining player doesn't control whole board?
2. Can a single department hold more than 2 kinds of students at a time?
3. What happens during elections? Is an election called within one department or against another dept?
4. What kind of player can win an election, ie can a player who didn't call an election win an election?
5. Once we know who could win an election, how do we calculate vote?*/
